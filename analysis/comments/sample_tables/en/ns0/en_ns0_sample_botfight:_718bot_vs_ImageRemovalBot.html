There is the original tavern, now known as the Little Bar, an intimate space with a [[fireplace]] and [[jukebox]].

The area upstairs from this, once hotel rooms, has mostly been (and is currently) used only for storage.  A small building directly across Masonic Way (the short, [[Car-free zone|pedestrian way]] on Commercial Street where the A-House is located) was long-used as a storage space but is now a restaurant called Grand Central.

Members of the [[Penutian]]-speaking family of languages, especially the [[Wintu]], arrived in central Northern California in the vicinity of [[Redding, California]] about 1200 years ago, likely from southern Oregon.  The Wintu possessed superior technology, were out-competing their Hokan-language family neighbors, and were expanding Wintu territory at the expense of the Okwanuchu and the [[Achomawi]] to the north, and the [[Yana people|Yana]] to the east.  It appears likely that even if Europeans and Americans not intervened (beginning in the 1820s), the Wintu would have absorbed or otherwise eliminated the Okwanuchu over the course of the coming centuries.<br/> <br/>-Anthropologist [[Alfred L.

Older vehicles (and those in [[developing countries]]) are more likely to have their patterns painted on, whereas modern appliances often carry [[Retroreflector|retro-reflective]] designs which reflect light from car headlights or torches.  Patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called '[[battenburg markings]]', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads - often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards if on the rear) or stripes (along the side - these were the first type or retro-reflective devices introduced, as the original retro-reflective material came only in tape form).  In some countries, in addition to retro-reflective markings, vehicles are now painted a bright yellow or orange, although in many other countries, red remains the colour for fire engines.<br/> <br/> Another passive marking is the word ''FIRE'', ''RESCUE'' or local language variant spelled out in reverse on the front of the vehicle.  This enables drivers of other vehicles to more easily identify an approaching fire service vehicle in their [[rear view mirror]]s.

The Turkish Parliament refused to grant permission for the operation and the division's equipment remained offshore on ships during the buildup for the war.  Arriving through Kuwait after the invasion had started, they were subject to multiple "SCUD" alerts while at Camps Wolf and Udairi, necessitating the retreat to bunkers in full chemical protective gear. The division was unable to deploy in time to start the invasion but joined it as a follow-on force in April 2003 attacking toward Tikrit and Mosul, and later became a major part of occupation forces during the post-war period. Headquartered in Saddam Hussein's former palaces, the 4th ID was deployed in the northern area of the [[Sunni Triangle]] near [[Tikrit]].  The 4th Infantry Division was spread all over Northern Iraq from Kirkuk to the Iranian border as far south as Balad Air Force Base in Balad Iraq.  The 3rd Brigade Combat Team Headquarters was assigned to Balad Air Base.  The 4th Infantry Division also disarmed the MEK warriors in Northern Iraq in July-August 2003.  On [[December 13]], [[2003]], the 1st Brigade of the 4th ID captured [[Saddam Hussein]], former [[President of Iraq]].  The division rotated out of Iraq in the Spring of [[2004]], and was relieved by the [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st Infantry Division]].<br/> <br/> * OIF 1 Casualties</td>

This was afterwards shelved by the action of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
