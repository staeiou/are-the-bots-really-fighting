In practice, "tolerance" indicates support for practices that prohibit ethnic and religious [[discrimination]]. Conversely, 'intolerance' may be used to refer to the discriminatory practices sought to be prohibited. Though developed to refer to the [[religious toleration]] of minority religious sects following the [[Protestant Reformation]], these terms are increasingly used to refer to a wider range of tolerated practices and groups, or of political parties or ideas widely considered objectionable.<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Toleration</ref><br/>-<br/>-The concept of toleration is controversial. For one, "toleration" does not raise the level of an actual [[principle]] or [[ethic]], such as other concepts (respect, [[Ethic of reciprocity|reciprocity]], love) do. [[liberalism|Liberal]] critics may see in it an inappropriate implication that the "tolerated" custom or behavior is an [[aberration]] or that authorities have a right to [[punishment|punish]] difference; such critics may instead emphasise notions such as [[Civic virtue|civility]], [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], or respect. Other critics may regard a narrow definition of 'tolerance' as more useful, since it does not require a false [[expression]] of enthusiasm for groups or practices which are genuinely disapproved of.<br/>-<br/>-As a practical matter, governments have always had to consider the question of which groups and practices to tolerate and which to persecute. The [[Edicts of Ashoka]] issued by [[Ashoka the Great]] in the [[Maurya Empire]] declared ethnic and religious tolerance. The later expanding [[Roman Empire]] faced the question of whether or to what extent practices or beliefs could be tolerated or vigorously persecuted. Likewise, during the [[Middle Ages]], the rulers of [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] or the [[Islamic Golden Age|Muslim Middle East]] sometimes extended toleration to minority religious groups, and sometimes did not. Jews in particular suffered under [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] persecutions in medieval [[Europe]].<ref name="Vartan">Vartan Gregorian, "Islam: A Mosaic, Not a Monolith", Brookings Institution Press, 2003, pg 26-38 ISBN 081573283X</ref><ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&letter=G&search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.</ref> A notable exception was [[Poland]], which served as a haven for European Jewry because of its relative tolerance - by the mid-sixteenth century, 80 percent of the world’s Jews lived in Poland. <ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html Jewish Virtual Library - Poland]</ref><br/>-<br/>-An early champion of toleration in Europe was [[Pawel Wlodkowic]], who at the [[Council of Constance]] advocated the [[pagan]] nations' rights.<ref>[http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-28175/Poland#396759.hook Britannica Online - Poland: The rule of Jagielo ]</ref> However, the development of a body of theory on the subject of toleration didn't begin until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Wars of Religion]] and persecutions that followed the breaks with the [[Catholic Church]] instigated by [[Martin Luther]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and others.  In response to the theory of persecution that was used to justify wars of religion and the execution of persons convicted of [[heresy]] and [[witchcraft]], writers such as [[Sebastian Castellio]] and [[Michel de Montaigne]] questioned the morality of religious persecution, and offered arguments for toleration. By contrast, Poland, which had been uniquely tolerant and ethnically as well as religiously diverse, officially confirmed its status as "a place of shelter for heretics" in the [[Warsaw Confederation | Confederation of Warsaw of 1573]],<ref>[http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=7748&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html Portal UNESCO, Poland - The General Confederation of Warsaw]</ref> the first toleration act in Europe.<ref>[http://www.polityka.pl/archive/do/registry/secure/showArticle?id=945 Dzieje podzielone, Prof. Janusz Tazbir, Polityka 03-07-2004]</ref><br/>-<br/>-A detailed and influential body of writing on the question of toleration was produced in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the seventeenth century, during and after the destructive [[English Civil Wars]]. [[John Milton]] and radical Parliamentarians such as [[Gerrard Winstanley]] argued that Christian and Jewish worship should be protected, and it was during the period that [[Oliver Cromwell]] allowed the return of Jews to England.  These early theories of toleration were limited however, and did not extend toleration to [[Roman Catholics]] (who were perceived as disloyal to their country) or [[atheists]] (who were held to lack any moral basis for action).  [[John Locke]], in his [[A Letter Concerning Toleration|Letter Concerning Toleration]] and [[Two Treatises of Government]] proposed a more detailed and systematic theory of toleration, which included a principle of [[Separation of Church and State]] that formed the basis for future constitutional democracies.  The British [[Toleration Act of 1689]] was the political result of seventeenth century theorists and political exigency, which despite the limited scope of the toleration it granted was nevertheless a key development in the history of toleration, which helped produce greater political stability in the British Isles.<br/>-  <br/>-The philosophers and writers of the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], especially [[Voltaire]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], promoted and further developed the notion of religious tolerance, which however was not sufficient to prevent the atrocities of the [[Reign of Terror]].  The incorporation by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and others of Locke's theories of toleration into the [[Constitution of the United States of America]] was arguably more successful.<br/>-<br/>-== Recent development ==<br/>-Though developed to refer to the [[religious toleration]] of minority religious sects following the [[Protestant Reformation]], the terms "toleration" and "tolerance" are increasingly used to refer to a wider range of tolerated practices and groups, such as the toleration of sexual practices and orientations, or of political parties or ideas widely considered objectionable.  Changing applications and understandings of the term can sometimes make debate on the question difficult.<br/>-<br/>-For example, a distinction is sometimes drawn between mere "Toleration" and a higher notion of "Religious Liberty":  <br/>-<br/>-<blockquote>Some philosophers [. . .] regard toleration and religious freedom as quite distinct things and emphasize the differences between the two.  They understand toleration to signify no more than forbearance and the permission given by the adherents of a dominant religion for other religions to exist, even though the latter are looked upon with disapproval as inferior, mistaken, or harmful.  In contrast these thinkers recognize religious liberty as as the recognition of equal freedom for all religions and denominations without any kind of discrimination among them [. . .] in the case of religious liberty, no one is rightfully possessed of the power not to tolerate or to cancel this liberty.<ref name=Zagorin5>Zagorin, Perez (2003) ''How the Idea of Religious Toleration Came to the West'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press).</ref></blockquote><br/>-<br/>-Discussions of toleration therefore often divided between those who view the term as a minimal and perhaps even historical virtue (perhaps today to be replaced by a more positive and robust appreciation of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] or [[Multiculturalism|diversity]]), and those who view it as a concept with an important continuing vitality, and who are more likely to use the term in considering contemporary issues regarding discrimination on the basis of race, nationality, gender, sexuality, disability, and other reasons.<br/>-<br/>-There are also debates with regard to the historical factors that produced the principle of toleration, as well as to the proper reasons toleration should be exercised, with some arguing that the growth of [[skepticism]] was an important or necessary factor in the development of toleration, and others arguing that religious belief or an evolving notion of respect for individual persons was or is the basis on which toleration was or should be practiced.<br/>-<br/>-== Tolerance and monotheism ==<br/>-One theory of the origins of religious intolerance, propounded by [[Sigmund Freud]] in ''Moses and Monotheism,'' links intolerance to monotheism.  More recently, [[Bernard Lewis]] and Mark Cohen have argued that the modern understanding of tolerance, involving concepts of national identity and equal citizenship for persons of different religions, was not considered a value by pre-modern Muslims or Christians, due to the implications of monotheism.<ref>Lewis (1997), p.321; (1984) p.65; Cohen (1995), p.xix</ref> The historian [[Geoffrey Rudolph Elton|G.R. Elton]] explains that in pre-modern times, monotheists viewed such toleration as a sign of weakness or even wickedness towards God. <ref>  quoted in Cohen (1995), p.xix</ref> The usual definition of tolerance in pre-modern times as Bernard Lewis puts it was that: <br/>-<br/>-{{cquote|I am in charge. I will allow you some though not all of the rights and privileges that I enjoy, provided that you behave yourself according to rules that I will lay down and enforce."<ref name=LewisBrandeis1>Lewis (2006), pp.25-36</ref>}}<br/>-<br/>-[[Mark Cohen]] states that it seems that all the monotheistic religions in power throughout the history have felt it proper, if not obligatory, to persecute nonconforming religions. <ref name="Cohen1"> Cohen (1995) p. xix </ref> Therefore, Cohen concludes, [[Islamic Golden Age|Medieval Islam]] and [[Middle Ages|Medieval Christianity]] in power should have persecuted non-believers in their lands and "Judaism, briefly in power during the Hasmonean period (second century BCE) should have persecuted pagan Idumeans". <ref name="Cohen1"/> Cohen continues: "When all is said and done, however, the historical evidence indicates that the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Jews of Islam]], especially during the formative and classical centuries (up to thirteenth century), experienced much less persecution than did the Jews of [[Christendom]]. This begs a more thorough and nuanced explanation than has hitherto been given."<ref name="Cohen1"/><br/>-<br/>-==Tolerating the intolerant==<br/>-Philosopher [[Karl Popper]]'s assertion in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' that we are warranted in refusing to tolerate intolerance illustrates that there are limits to tolerance.<br/>-<br/>-In particular, should a tolerant society tolerate intolerance? What if by tolerating action "A", society destroys itself? Tolerance of "A" could be used to introduce a new thought system leading to intolerance of vital institution "B". It is difficult to strike a balance and different societies do not always agree on the details, indeed different groups within a single society also often fail to agree. The current suppression of [[Nazism]] in [[Germany]] is considered intolerant by some countries, for instance, while in Germany itself it is Nazism which is considered intolerably intolerant.<br/>-<br/>-Philosopher [[John Rawls]] devotes a section of his influential and controversial book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' to the problem of whether a just society should or should not tolerate the intolerant, and to the related problem of whether or not, in any society, the intolerant have any right to complain when they are not tolerated.<br/>-<br/>-Rawls concludes that a just society must be tolerant; therefore, the intolerant must be tolerated, for otherwise, the society would then be intolerant, and so unjust. However, Rawls qualifies this by insisting that society and its social institutions have a reasonable right of self-preservation that supersedes the principle of tolerance. Hence, the intolerant must be tolerated but ''only insofar as they do not endanger the tolerant society and its institutions''.<br/>-<br/>-Similarly, continues Rawls, while the intolerant might forfeit the right to complain when they are themselves not tolerated, other members of society have a right, perhaps even a duty, to complain on their behalf, again, as long as society itself is not endangered by these intolerant members. The [[ACLU]] is a good example of a social institution that protects the rights of the intolerant, as it frequently defends the right to free speech of such intolerant organizations as the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<br/>-<br/>-== References ==<br/>-<br/>+{{Expand|date=January 2007}}<br/>+{{Mergewith|Toleration|date=July 2008}}<br/>+{{For|the Religioustolerance.org website|Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance}}<br/>+[[Image:CrossMenorahOxford 20051225KaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Christian cross|cross]] of the [[war memorial]] and a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] for [[Hanukkah]] coexist in [[Oxford]].]]<br/>+<br/>+'''Religious toleration''' is the condition of accepting or permitting others' [[religion|religious]] beliefs and practices which disagree with one's own.<br/>+<br/>+In a country with a [[state religion]], ''toleration'' means that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths.

At issue is not merely whether other faiths should be permitted, but also whether a ruler who is a believer may be tolerant, or permit his subordinates to be. In the [[Middle Ages]], toleration of [[Judaism]] was a contentious issue throughout [[Christendom]]. Today, there are concerns about toleration of [[Christianity]] in [[Sharia|Islamic states]] (see also [[dhimmi]]).<br/>+<br/>+[[Proselytism]] can be a contentious issue; it can be regarded as an offence against the validity of others' religions, or as an expression of one's own faith.<br/>+<br/>+==The element of objection== <br/>+<br/>+For individuals, religious toleration generally means an attitude of acceptance towards other people's religions. It does not mean that one views other religions as equally true; merely that others have the right to hold and practice their beliefs. This element of objection is important. People, who take these matters seriously, often experience distress when they are confronted with religious beliefs that they regard as idolatrous, [[Superstition|superstitious]], [[Heresy|heretical]] or [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]]. <br/>+<br/>+==Contexts of religious tolerance== <br/>+<br/>+At least five contexts of religious tolerance can be distinguished. Religious tolerance as a state sanctioned practice can more precisely termed ''civil tolerance''. Civil tolerance is concerned with "the policy of the state towards religious dissent".<ref>Coffey 2000: 11</ref> In contrast to this, ecclesiastical tolerance is concerned with the degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church.<ref>Coffey 2000: 12</ref> Without this distinction, the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]] in England could not be adequately understood.   <br/>+<br/>+Furthermore, there is also a ''social'' and a ''polemical'' context of religious tolerance. The grand theme of ''divine tolerance'' is the emphasis on "the patience and longsuffering of God" as it is frequently portrayed in the Christian [[Bible]]; This image of God has been invoked by early Christian advocates of toleration.  <br/>+<br/>+===The polemical context===<br/>+<br/>+Contemporary authors such as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Daniel C. Dennett]] have all challenged the tolerance of religion. In ''[[The End of Faith]]'', Sam Harris asserts that we should be unwilling to tolerate unjustified beliefs about morality, spirituality, politics, and the origin of humanity. In his [[preface]] to ''[[The God Delusion]]'', Richard Dawkins says, "If this book works as I intend, religious readers who open it will be atheists when they put it down."<ref name="preface">Dawkins, Richard.

[[Procedural memory]] can also be referred to as [[implicit memory]] which  reinstates the fact that learning is done automatically<ref name="Bacdayan"> Bacdayan P., Cohen M.

For example, one can explain the semantic concept of a stop sign very easily as one is consciously aware when forming and retrieving these memories from what is known as [[declarative memory]].  Yet with [[procedural memory]] it much more difficult to explain the memories stored within it because one is not likely consciously aware of learning about it- such as explaining how to ride a bike.

Procedural memory is often not easily verbalized, but can be used without consciously thinking about it. Procedural memory can reflect simple stimulus-response pairing or more extensive patterns of action sequences learned over time. In contrast, declarative memory can generally be put into words. Using [[neuroimaging]] technology, it has been found that declarative memory uses different parts of the brain- mainly the medial temporal lobe. Procedural memory has been found to rely primarily on other brain areas such as the [[cerebellum]] and the [[basal ganglia]] as described in more detail below. However, in spite of these distinctions, procedural and declarative memories are not entirely mutually exclusive. In some therapeutic techniques for individuals with damage to a brain region such as the cerebellum declarative memory can be used to learn motor skills; for example, a motor task can be learned by repeating a sequence verbally. A drawback to these techniques is that declarative memory deteriorates relatively quickly and so needs to be constantly refreshed<ref>Saywell, N., Taylor, D. (2008).

In contrast, declarative memory can generally be put into words. Examples of procedural learning are learning to ride a bike, learning to touch type, learning to play a musical instrument or learning to swim. Procedural memory can be very durable.<br/> <br/>-In cognitive psychology, the term procedural knowledge denotes knowledge of how to accomplish a task or action sequence and often pertains to knowledge which, unlike declarative knowledge, cannot be easily articulated by the individual or knowledge that is non-conscious.

For example, most individuals can easily recognize a specific face as "attractive" or a specific joke as "funny," but they cannot explain how exactly they arrived at that conclusion or they cannot provide a working definition of "attractiveness" or being "funny."  Research by a cognitive psychologist [[Pawel Lewicki]] has demonstrated that procedural knowledge can be acquired by nonconscious processing of information about covariations.<br/>+<br/>+==Effects of lesions==<br/>+Studies of people with certain brain injuries (such as damage to the [[hippocampus]]) suggest that procedural memory and [[episodic memory]] use different parts of the brain, and can work independently. For example, some patients are repeatedly trained in a task and remember previous training, but do not improve in a task (functioning declarative memory, damaged procedural memory). Other patients put through the same training can't recall having been through the experiment, but their performance in the task improves over time (functioning procedural memory, damaged declarative memory).<br/>+<br/>+Damage to the [[cerebellum]] and the [[basal ganglia]] seems to particularly affect procedural learning.<br/>+<br/>+== See also ==<br/>+* [[Aging and memory]]<br/>+* [[Sequence learning]]<br/>+* [[Muscle memory]]<br/>+<br/>+==References==<br/>+{{reflist}}<br/>+<br/>+{{Memory}}<br/> <br/> <br/>-__TOC__<br/>+[[Category:Memory processes]]<br/>+[[Category:Skills]]<br/>+[[Category:Technical communication]]<br/> <br/>-=Procedural Learning=<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-== Skill Acquisition ==<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-=== Skill ===<br/>-[[Image:CoryPesaturo1.jpg|thumb|Playing the accordion requires procedural skills]]<br/>-A '''skill''' can be defined as one's attempt to make a behavioural change or learn a desired task using the least amount of energy and time. This is often achieved through repetition, with the end result being a smooth and seemingly effortless execution of an activity <ref>Yamadori, A, et al (1996). Neurological Basis for Skill Learning. Cognitive Brain Research, 5, 49-55.</ref>. An example of this would be the learning of an instrument- though very difficult at first, repetition creates competence and an ease of movement. Thus a [[skill]] can only improve with practice. <ref>http://www.exrx.net/Psychology/Skill.html</ref> For one to acquire a new [[skill]] one travels through the three stages of skill acquisition and eventually ends up moving from being a [[novice]] to an [[expert]] (see below).<br/>-<br/>-It has been suggested that memory for self-performed tasks is much better than for memories that are just verbal tasks.<ref name="Koriat"> Koriat, K. &Pearlman-Avnion, S. (2003). Memory organization of action events and its relationship to memory performance. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General. 132 (3)</ref> This appears to be the case because of the enactment effect, or the memory for actions.<ref name="Koriat"></ref>  For example, the enactment effect stresses that there are representational differences between verbal tasks and self-promotion tasks.  This is because task performance involves both [[recall]] and [[recognition]] of action phases in comparison to the encoding of a verbal phrase.<ref name="Koriat"></ref> Also enactment requires the planning, programming, and execution of tasks rather than just verbalizing it.  Therefore, the enactment heightens the features of a task.  Furthermore, there is evidence that the intention to perform a task greatly improves the memory performance later on.<ref name="Koriat"></ref>  The amount of errors in performance also decreases with enactment as memory is enhanced by reducing the number of false recalls.<ref name="Koriat"></ref>  In addition, self-performed tasks are encoded at the same rate with or without attention and with deep or shallow processing, which indicates that these type of tasks are largely automatic.<ref name="Classen"> Classen, J., Joachim, L., Wise, S. P., Hallett, M. & Cohen ,L. G. (1998). Rapid plasticity of human cortical movement representation induced by practice. Journal of Neurophysiology, 79, 1117-1123</ref><br/>-<br/>-=== Cognitive Stage ===<br/>-<br/>-This is the first stage of skill acquisition in which an individual has complete conscious awareness and is striving to obtain the skill.  Full attention is generally necessary at this stage and thus [[declarative memory]] holds the representation of the skill<ref>Newell & Simon (1972): General Problem Solver</ref>.  The main goal at this stage is to take whatever actions are needed to get from the place where they are at currently to the mastery of the skill.  A lot of visual and verbal guidance and practice in the form of trial and error are used extensively to help move closer to the mastery of a skill.  To use a musician as an example, they would be seen as novice or even non-musician at this stage.  They are generally learning the basics and need specific instructions from instructors to help them correct there errors as the student will not often know how to correct it themselves.<ref name="Gaser"> Gaser C., Schlaug, G. (2003) Brain structures differ between musicians and non-musicians. The Journal of Neuroscience, 23,(27), 9240-9245</ref><br/>-<br/>-=== Associative Stage ===<br/>-<br/>-This is the second stage of skill acquisition and at this stage the person is still consciously aware of what is taking place.  However, information is retrieved much quicker and less deliberate attention is needed.  The skill is now moving into [[procedural memory]] as movements become much more fluid and contain fewer errors.  The associative stage is also known as the practice stage where events are repeated over and over to create [[overlearning]] or a [[perma-store]] of the skill.  If we use the musician again as an example, the musician would now be seen as an amateur or intermediate as they have mastered the basics but still require much more practice in order to be considered a master.  The instructor or teacher in this stage is needed to provide the learner with additional information focusing on specific actions and helpful pointers for fine-tuning.<ref name="Gaser"></ref><br/>-<br/>-=== Autonomous Stage ===<br/>-<br/>-This is the third and final stage in skill acquisition and at this point the skill has moved from being conscious to largely unconscious.  This is to say that this skill is now part of [[procedural memory]].  Performance of the skill has been automatized and rapid cognitive monitoring becomes almost completely eliminated.  With respect to the musician example, they would now be seen as a professional or master.  They are now able to perform in an automatic fashion without stress, and begin to strategize rather than worrying about whether they will play the right tune or not.  The instructor or teacher only needs to facilitate learning as the student will have the knowledge to correct their own errors if made.<ref name="Gaser"></ref><br/>-<br/>-== '''Motor Learning''' ==<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-[[Motor learning]] is a general term found within the domain of skill acquisition and incorporates learning muscle movements within sequences and then repeating them until they can be performed without hesitation or thought processing. An example of this is a triathlete training in cycling, running and swimming who must train their muscles to operate in certain ways for the most time efficient race <ref name="Chapman"> Chapman, A. R., Vicenzio, B., Blanch, P., Dowlan, S., & Hodges , P. W. (2008). Does cycling effect motor coordination of the leg during running in elite triathletes? Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, 11, 371-380.</ref>.This is quite often thought of as [[muscle memory]], which is a misnomer as motor learning refers to the cognitive processes that drive a body to interact with the world <ref name="Koriat">Koriat, K. & Pearlman-Avnion, S. (2003). Memory organization of action events and its relationship to memory performance. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General. 132 (3)</ref>.  Motor learning, like skill acquisition, is best done with enactment, which can increase one’s attention to the salient features of a task leading to an increase in memory performance and thus a decrease in the number of errors <ref name="Koriat"></ref>.<br/>-<br/>-Due to the cognitive nature of motor learning there is some neural reorganization and activation/deactivation in the brain before, during and after the motor task becomes fluent <ref name="Duque">Duque, J., Mazzocchio, R., Stefan, K., Hummel, F., Olivier, E. & Cohen, L. G. (2008). Memory formation in the motor cortex ipsilateral to a training hand. Cerebral Cortex, 18, 1395-1406.</ref>. This reorganization is thought to involve [[long-term potentiation]] that supports learning and memory <ref name="Classen">Classen, J., Joachim, L., Wise, S. P., Hallett, M. & Cohen ,L. G. (1998). Rapid plasticity of human cortical movement representation induced by practice. Journal of Neurophysiology, 79, 1117-1123.</ref>. This cortical reorganization generally occurs in the motor cortices on the [[contralateral]] side, or side opposite the part of the body being used <ref name="Duque"></ref>. However some [[ipsilateral]], or the same side of the brain regions involved for carrying out those motor movements, cortical encoding does occur. Therefore there are memory traces developing in the motor areas of the brain with practice <ref name="Duque"></ref>. These memory traces make later enactment of the movement much easier. <br/>-<br/>-Motor learning of tasks occurs in several phases, much like skill acquisition, except the focus is on the motor movements of a task and repetition. The first stage includes rapid performance gains over the initial few trials and corresponds to the acquisition of a task-relevant routine. This usually includes such cortical areas as the [[prefrontal cortex]], anterior [[cingulate cortex]], and the posterior [[parietal lobe]]<ref name="Clare Kelly"> Clare Kelly, A. M. & Garavan, H. (2004) </ref>. Following this there is a stage of consolidation which can last several hours <ref name="Clare Kelly"></ref>. The final stage is repetition, which requires significantly more time than the first two stages. This is because as repetition of the movement occurs there is a slower pace at which the movement is mastered due the adjustments that are consistently made to perfect the movement. These adjustments are achieved through sensory and motor pathways providing continuous feedback. Thousands of training trails are required and are associated with expansion or increases in activation in motor areas of the brain, as well as differing levels of activation throughout the motor regions. <ref name="Clare Kelly"></ref> Most motor skills can be overlearned to the point where they are almost implicit and do not need conscious effort to perform the task<ref name="Underleider">Underleider, L. G., Doyon, J., & Karni, A. (2002). Imaging brain plasticity during motor skill learning. Neurobiology Learning and Memory, 78, 553-564. </ref><br/>-<br/>-Peripheral to the central nervous system there are control mechanisms that have been found in motor control studies. For example, the use of reciprocally activating sets of antagonist and agonist muscles that can produce torques on a desired joint. This cocontraction is in flux when a novel motor task is being performed which leads to overlap in muscle use. A balance between antagonist and agonist muscle can be found leading to no kinematic effect, and therefore no movement <ref name="Darainy">Darainy, M. & Ostry, D. J. (2008). Muscle cocontraction following dynamics learning. Experimental Brain Research, 190, 153-163. </ref>. This cocontraction control has been documented in the early stages of motor learning with a decline as learning progresses; however, it is never fully absent, indicating the need for continuous adaptation <ref name="Darainy"></ref>. The cocontraction often last for several hundred milliseconds after motor movement has terminated, demonstrating the lasting effects of learning in muscle memory <ref name="Darainy"></ref>.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-=== '''Motor Memory by Observation''' ===<br/>-<br/>-The ipsilateral hemisphere to the arm that is learning a task plays a role in the learning but it is not as strong as the dominant contraleteral hemisphere <ref name="Crischimagna"> Crischimagna-Hemminger, S. E., Donchon, O., Gazzaniga, M. S., & Shadmeher, R. (2003). Learned dynamics of reaching movements generalize from dominant to non-dominant arm. Journal of Neurophysiology, 89, 167-176.</ref>. <br/>-This is similar to learning by observation and learning with physical practice. These types of learning can be compared with cortical imaging.<br/>-For example, the primary motor cortex (M1) and other motor cortices contain specific neurons that are activated during movement, as they are sensitive to the pattern of forces and posture of limbs, as well as to the observations of said movements <ref name="Crischimagna"></ref>. Although motor skills are acquired through physical practice, the mere observation of movements has also been shown to lead to performance gains <ref name="Karni2"> Karni, A., Meyer, G., Rey-Hipolito, C., Jezzard, P., Adams, M.

Proc National Academy of Science, USA, 95, 861-868. </ref>. Mere observation of movements can lead to the formation of lasting memory traces in movement representations that resemble memory traces developed with physical training; this is termed ‘observation-induced motor memory’ <ref name="Stefan"></ref>. The formation of motor memory is initiated with observation and thus it acts as an important step for motor skill acquisition. Therefore, observational practice may improve performance through the use of similar mechanisms in physical training <ref name="Stefan">Stefan, K., Cohen, L.

Brain structures differ between musicians and non-musicians. The Journal of Neuroscience, 23(27), 9240-9245. </ref> found that there is a significant difference in terms of [[gray matter]] volume in the superior parietal (visual-spatial), inferior temporal gyrus, primary motor cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and auditory brain regions of professional musicians compared to amateur or non-musicians. Although [[white matter]] does not appear to be influenced by procedural memory training glial cells have been observed to increase in volume. While plausible that such gray matter volume differences may arise from genetic predispositions rather than experience, meaning that perhaps individuals select their professions (in part at least) based on the morphology of their brains, the literature suggests that the differences observed are likely the result of [[synaptic plasticity]] and learning <ref name=Gaser/>.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-= Anatomy of Procedural Learning =<br/>-<br/>-== '''Brain Regions Associated with Skill Acquisition and Motor Learning''' ==<br/>-<br/>- <br/>-The present understanding of the association between learning a motor skill and cortical changes remains debated and difficult to establish; however, with recent advances in technology, researchers are able to study the brain while actions are being performed, for example, when reaching for objects or experiencing rotating visual stimuli. Thus motor learning studies use imaging technologies such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) Nilsson et al, 2000), functional [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) <ref name=" Underleider "></ref> <ref name=" van Mier "/>, [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) <ref name="Kolb"> Kolb, B. Whishaw, I. Q. (2003). Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology, 5th Ed. Worth Publishers, New York, New York.</ref>,and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which is used to measure cerebral hemoglobin oxygenation in the sensorimotor cortices of both hemispheres <ref name=" Underleider "></ref>. In conjunction with cortical imaging, motor skill learning is often investigated through measurement of reduction in reaction times and number of errors and/or by a change in movement synergy and kinematics <ref name=" Underleider "/>.<br/>-<br/>-Generally as skills are practiced there are related decreases in brain activity, which reflect the efficient use of specific neuronal circuits that are topographically organized <ref name=" Clare Kelly "></ref>. For example, when learning how to tap a sequence with one’s fingers there is an increase in the neuronal activity, thus indicating the recruitment of additional cortical units, or the strengthening response of a particular region to complete the task <ref name=" Clare Kelly "/>. As the sequence tapping become less effortful there is a corresponding decrease in cortical activity. <br/>-<br/>-Behavioural studies have shown that the brain might update the mechanism for sensorimotor control in every trial that they do with a novel task <ref name=" Donchin "> Donchin, O., Francis, J. T., & Shadmehr, R. (2003). Quantifying generalization from trial-by-trial behavior of adaptive systems that learn with basis functions: Theory and experiments in human motor control, The Journal of Neuroscience 23(27), 9032–9045.</ref>. Generally models looking at motor learning in this way use discrete movements that are constricted by specific postures. In this way they are different from rhythmic or sequential movements because they require a start and stop to the movement and thus go in small bursts of movement <ref name=" Underleider "></ref>.Some examples of discrete movements would be reaching to grasp an object, or kicking or striking a ball. <br/>-<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Kendama.jpg|thumb|Kendama Toy]]<br/>-<br/>-Researchers Ikegami and Taga (2008) <ref name=" Ikegami "> </ref>used the [[Kendama]] toy to assess the motor learning for using multiple joints in a particular pattern to get to an end result, for example a motor task completed with a tool. This tool requires a quick and dynamic movement of the hand to swing the ball attached to the string into the cup. This is a novel task that requires precise manipulation of the tool in combination with multi-joint control, and eye-hand coordination. The initial stages of this task are quite difficult; however, this changes with practice trials and performance improves <ref name=" Ikegami "> Ikegami, T. & Taga, G. (2008). Decrease in cortical activation during learning of multi-joint discrete motor task. Experimental Brain Research, 191, 221-236.</ref>. This type of motor learning is associated with contralateral left sensorimotor cortex activation and decreases with practice. This reduction  in cortical activation correlates with the decrease in integrated muscle torques of the upper limb, or the arm being used to swing the ball into the cup. This indicates that changes in motor commands play a role in generating the muscle torques used to effectively perform the task and indicates that less sensory input needed to successfully perform a task<ref name=" Ikegami "> </ref>. Therefore the more motor learning that takes place, the less cortical activity is needed to perform a task<ref name=" Ikegami "/>.<br/>-<br/>-The motor cortex is strongly involved with motor learning, and researchers Kolb and Winshaw (2005) <ref name=" Kolb "> </ref> used TMS to map this activity during learning. As a skill is learned, the cortical area of the [[motor cortex]] is enlarged and this enlargement corresponds to the area of the body being used <ref name=" Kolb "></ref>. The changes in the structure of the motor cortex cannot be detected by an MRI until a few weeks after motor learning has had many repeated trials; however, differences from before learning and after learning are significant <ref name=" Underleider "></ref>. During the learning process, PET can be utilized to see that both the left [[parietal]] and motor cortex are activated <ref name=" Koriat "></ref> and cortical reorganization of the primary motor cortex (M1) is evident during the initial stages of skill acquisition <ref name=" Duque "></ref>. Thus the process of acquiring implicit knowledge requires a reorganization of the motor cortex <ref name=" Kolb "/>.<br/>-<br/>-Classen, Joachim, Wise, Hallett & Cohen (1998) found that practicing fingers movements in a particular direction leaves a short-lasting memory trace in the [[contralateral]] M1 and these changes are linked to the types and magnitude of motor action <ref name=" Duque "></ref> <ref name="Perez"> Perez, M.

This rapid M1 plasticity occurs through synaptic modification of the local horizontal circuitry, which is modulated through [[NMDA]] receptors. These changes are made permanent with long-term potentiation and long-term depression that act as up and down regulators depending on the pattern of activity<ref name=" Underleider "/>.<br/>-<br/>-Other regions of the brain have been associated with skill acquisition. For example, in the early phase of learning there is significant activity in the [[cerebellum]], right anterior [[cingulate]], dorsal premotor, and inferior parietal regions. However, as practice continues, the cerebellar and cortical regions decrease their level of activity, and as movements become automatic, activity remains in the striatum and motor cortical regions <ref name=" Underleider "></ref><ref name="Radvansky">Radvansky,G.(2006)''Human Memory''. University of Notre Dame: Pearson Education</ref>. Furthermore, the [[striatum]] appears to play a large role  in the use of cognitive strategies and working memory with extended practice, and from this it seems likely that it plays a large role in long-term storage of well-learned sequences of movements <ref name=" Underleider "/>. <br/>-<br/>-The cerebellum plays a particularly interesting role in the stages of skill acquisition such that it has been attributed to sensory prediction (the ability to maintain a continual flow in our movements and our perceptions of the world by responding to a stimulus with a prediction for the next stimulus), as well as the ability to process and learn from visual input<ref>Saywell,N.(2008).The role of the cerebellum in procedural learning--are there implications for physiotherapists' clinical practice? ''Physiotherapy Theory and Practice''. 24, 321-328. </ref>; for example, by watching someone use a tool, which is a motor skill, you are better able to use it yourself. <br/>-<br/>-The cerebellum is also an important area of the brain for the commitment and retrieval of procedural memories. It has often been called a "comparator" because it detects mistakes in movement by comparing them to aspects of the skill that have been learned and remembered, thus refining the habit or skill that is required<ref>Saywell,N.(2008).The role of the cerebellum in procedural learning--are there implications for physiotherapists' clinical practice? ''Physiotherapy Theory and Practice''. 24, 321-328. </ref>. Memory retrieval is necessary for procedural learning, because without retrieval, it would be impossible to achieve sensory prediction.<br/>-<br/>-The [[basal ganglia]] is another cortical structure involved in procedural memory. It has been observed through numerous studies that people with damage to this area (especially in degenerative cases such as [[dementia]]) have extreme difficulty in performing procedural tasks such as tennis, sewing, or playing piano, but often have remarkably less problems with tasks involving [[declarative memory]]<ref name="Gonzalez">Gonzalez, R., et al. (2008). Deficits in Complex Motor Functions, Despite No Evidence of Procedural Learning Deficits, Among HIV Individuals With History of Substance Dependence. American Psychological Association, 22. 776-786</ref>.<br/>-<br/>-The cortical activation becomes more complex when comparing regions that are active during different stages of learning. For example, there is a high level of activation of the right dorsal premotor cortex  during initial unskilled performance of a task, which is mainly guided by external sensory cues <ref name="van Mier"> </ref>. Activation of the supplementary motor area is greater during skilled performance, and this stage of learning is self-initiated and guided by internal cues <ref name="van Mier"> </ref>.  Furthermore, left cerebellar activation decreases with practice and is highly active with novel tasks<ref name="van Mier"> </ref>. The right dorsal premotor cortex and supplementary motor area are associated with sequential aspects of a task. This is in contrast with the left dorsal premotor cortex and the right cerebellum which are more likely to be associated with the temporal aspects of a task <ref name="van Mier"> </ref>.<br/>-<br/>-Overall, the areas that are directly related with motor performance and learning are the primary motor cortex, anterior cerebellum, basal ganglia and striatum. <ref name="Gonzalez"></ref><ref name="van Mier"> </ref><br/>-<br/>-=Affecting Procedural Memory=<br/>-<br/>-As procedural memory, and implicit non-declarative forms of memory in general, are distinct from declarative memory it is both important and very interesting to look at the ways in which procedural memory and skill acquisition can be impacted. Repeated findings in studies have shown that impairments to procedural memory are generally independent of compromised declarative memory, and vice versa <ref>Yamadori, A, et al (1996). Neurological Basis for Skill Learning. Cognitive Brain Research, 5, 49-55.</ref>. Thus, while some illnesses and traumas may affect procedural memory, declarative memory can potentially remain in tact. The following examples show the various ways that procedural learning can be altered, or not.  <br/>-<br/>-== The Impact of Disease on Procedural Memory ==<br/>-Many impairments to procedural memory occur because of health conditions that are degenerative to neural anatomy pertinent to implicit memory and skill acquisition. <br/>-<br/>-[[Parkinson's Disease]]- Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a condition that affects the efficiency of procedural memory and skills acquisition. Those with PD, especially elderly individuals, score much lower than healthy individuals (old and young) on procedural memory tasks such as sound-form association, mazes, and Braille learning. It has been found that while PD affects both implicit and explicit memories <ref name= "Allain">Allain H, et al (1995). Explicit and Procedural Memory in Parkinson’s Disease. Biomedicine & Parkinson’s Disease, 49, 179-186.</ref> implicit memory is more drastically impaired <ref name="McDowall">McDowall, John, Jared, G. Smith. Impaired Higher Order Implicit Sequence Learning on the Verbal Version of the Serial Reaction Time Task in Patients with Parkinson’s Disease. Neuropsychology, 18, 679-691</ref>. PD patients' deficiency in procedural memory tasks has been theorized to be the result of an enhancement of memory inhibition. This means that people with PD may only be able to operate with newer memories, making practice a useless endeavor. Also, because of damage to various areas in the brain made by PD, studies have shown that there may be disruption in the steps of learning, automation and recall, making fluid motor skills difficult <ref name="Allain"/>. One of these areas is the basal ganglia, which has been previously discussed as being implicated in skill acquisition<ref name="McDowall"/>. Dopamine deficiencies, which are linked to procedural memory, are also found in PD patients <ref name="Allain"/>.<br/>-<br/>-[[Huntington's Disease]]- Huntington's Disease (HD) is a disorder that involves involuntary movements and eventual dementia. HD patients show impaired ability to recall information that they have previously been exposed to or learned<ref name= "Heindel"><br/>-Heindel, W, Butters, N., Salmon D. (1988). Impaired Learning of A Motor Skill In Patients with Huntington’s Disease, 102. 141-147</ref>, and perform at a less than normal level in certain procedural skill tasks. Akin to other conditions that impair procedural memory and skill acquisition, HD's affect on the basal ganglia is also associated with lack of ability in skill learning<ref>Cavaco,S (2007). Procedural Memory in Huntington's Disease. World Congress on Huntington's Disease. http://www.worldcongress-hd.net/html/2007/programme/wchd2007-programme-booklet.pdf?tm=1195018831</ref>. While it has been established that the neurological degeneration characteristic of HD bring about issues in procedural learning, some of this difficulty may be partly to do with HD patients' general motor dysfunction <ref name="Heindel"/><br/>-<br/>-==Psychological Disorders and Procedural Memory==<br/>-<br/>-[[Bipolar disorder]] - Bipolar disorder is categorized by unusual shifts in a person’s mood, ranging from bouts of mania to depression <ref>http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/bipolar-disorder/complete-index.shtml</ref>. The exact causes of bipolar disorder is not completely known but results from tests on procedural memory suggest that bipolar disorder most likely involves a distributed function of the temporal lobe, but not the basal ganglia. The result of this is that bipolar patients have a deficit in declarative memory but no loss of procedural memory as compared to individuals without the disorder<ref>Van Gorp, W.G., Altshuler, L., Theberge, D.C., Mintz, J. (1999). Declarative and Procedural Memory in Bipolar Disorder. Biological psychiatry, 46. 525-531</ref><br/>-<br/>-[[Psychosis]] -  Psychosis is reflected by a disturbance in brain functioning that often involves a loss of contact with reality. <ref>http://www.cmha.ca/BINS/content_page.asp?cid=3-105</ref> Similar to those suffering from bipolar disorder, individuals with some forms of psychosis are able to perform motor procedural learning tasks at the same level as those not suffering from a psychosis. They also show no deficits in cognitive or motor procedural learning. <ref name =Schmond>Schmond, B., Brand, N., Kuipers, T. (1992). Procedural learning of cognitive and motor skills in psychotic patients. Schizophrenia Research, 8. 157-170</ref> Interestingly when psychotic patients were asked to learn the rules of a game, they were actually able to learn the rules much better and made less error than those who do did not suffer from psychosis. <ref name = Schmond/>  [[Schizophrenia]] is a type of psychosis that is categorized by the [[DSM-IV-TR]] as breaks from reality that may include but are not limited to delusions and hallucinations. <ref>http://www.cmha.ca/BINS/content_page.asp?cid=3-100&lang=1</ref> Notably individuals suffering from this disorder have shown a shallower learning slope, meaning that they learned less then control groups in tests measuring declarative memory. However, individuals with schizophrenia have similar learning slopes or show approximately the same amount of learning as people without schizophrenia when tested on procedural memory tasks. <ref name = Kern/><br/>-<br/>-[[Amnesia]] - Amnesia is a condition that effects the tenacity of memory as well as the ability to use it and it can have a very localized effect on the brain and memory. More specifically, it has been found that [[anterograde amnesia] -a condition that inhibits the formation of new memories- primarily effects the [[medial temporal lobe]], thus almost exclusively impairing declarative memory. Studies have shown that not only is amnesia in such patients not complete, but it also preserves near normal-to-normal levels of perceptual-motor skill acquisition <ref name= "Cavaco">Cavaco, S. et al (2004). The scope of preserved procedural memory in amnesia. Brain, 127. 8, pp. 1853-1867</ref>. Similarly, in the famous case of the amnesiac [[HM]], it was found that his basal ganglia- a section of brain anatomy important for procedural memory- was normal, and that in tests of his ability for procedural memory, learning also seemed normal <ref>Xu, Yaoda, Corkin, Suzanna (2001).H.M. Revisits the Tower of Hanoi Puzzle, 15, 69-79</ref>. Another excellent example of the durability of procedural memory in anterograde amnesiacs is in the musician [[Clive Wearing]]. Wearing was a classical musician who suffered from encephalitis resultant of the herpes simplex virus; while he could not remember someone whom he had only met minutes ago, Wearing could still play piano or conduct music with much the same skill as he could before the onset of amnesia <ref name= "Radvansky"/>. Anterograde amnesia is therefore interesting because it helps to show us the difference between declarative and non-declarative memory, showing a preservation in procedural memory; this effect is also seen in [[retrograde amnesia]], or the forgetting of memories previous to an amnesia-inducing incident, though are not quite as pristine as with anterograde amnesia <ref name="Radvansky"/>. <br/>-''Children with Amnesia:'' Similar to adults who suffer from amnesia, children show deficits on both episodic and semantic memory but in the past there have been questions regarding whether or not procedural memory would be affected differently in a younger population. However, test results show that children with amnesia do not differ in procedural memory from their adult counterparts with procedural memory remaining unaffected in cases of children with amnesia.<ref>Ostergard, A.L. (1987). Episodic, semantic and procedural memory in a case of amnesia at an early age. Neuropsychologia, 25. 341-357</ref>.<br/>-<br/>-[[Depression]] - Poor performance on procedural memory tasks are associated with some forms of depression in homosexual/bisexual males who have HIV. <ref name = Castellou> Castellou. (1998). Apathy, depression and cognitive perform in HIV-1 infection. Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience, 10 </ref>. "HIV attacks the immune system, resulting in a chronic, progressive illness" <ref>http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dc-ma/aids-sida/index-eng.php</ref> that can cause some suffers to become depressed. Depression, which is associated with an overall “feeling of helpless”, can involve both affective/cognitive symptoms (mood/emotional symptoms) and somatic (physical) symptoms. <ref>http://www.cmha.ca/BINS/content_page.asp?cid=3-86-87</ref>  Interestingly, increased levels of affective/cognitive symptoms of depression are associated with poorer performances on procedural learning tasks than if the individual had increased levels of somatic symptoms of depression.<ref name = Castellou/> While the reason for the distinction in procedural learning deficits between affective and somatic symptoms is not yet completely understood, depression has been linked to involve a dysfunction of the basal ganglia, particularly the caudate nucleus which could explain why depression can be correlated with poorer performance on procedural tasks, but have no effect <br/>-on episodic memory<ref name = Castellou/>.<br/>-<br/>-==Disability and Procedural Memory==<br/>-<br/>-[[Williams syndrome]] (WS) is a genetic condition that is association with chromosomal mutations and several severe medical conditions such as  facial and organ abnormalities, including damage to the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. <ref name=Vicari>Vicari, S., Bellucci, S., Carlesino G.A. (2001). Procedural learning distinct in children with Williams syndrome. Neuropsychologia, 39. 665-677</ref> It also creates developmental challenges and has been linked to impaired procedural memory. <ref name =Vicari/> In particular to procedural memory, children who suffer from WS will have problems solving any tasks that relies on temporal (time) sequencing. <ref name= Vicari/> WS is different from Down syndrome (DS), a similar form of chromosomal mutation, in that individuals with DS will show impaired ability on explicit memory tests, but have no impairments in procedural memory. <ref name =Vicari/> This is interesting because it suggests that the  procedural learning deficits in WS children is not a universal symptom of all developmentally disabled individuals, but specific to this group. <ref name =Vicari/>.<br/>-<br/>-==Procedural Memory and Aging==<br/>-<br/>-Just as disease and injury can affect various components of memory, aging does not affect memory unilaterally, but rather alters different forms of memory in different ways. It is difficult to ascertain a global effect of aging on procedural memory, as different neural components are responsible for various stages of skill acquisition (i.e. different regions of the brain are implicated in acquisition and proceduralization, or making an acquired skill automatic).  However, a decline in the ability to remember and learn is fairly common in the elderly, including a decline in skill acquisition and reduced levels of performance in motor tasks<ref name="Kennedy">Kennedy, M.K, Raz,N. Age, Sex and Regional Brain Volumes Predict Perceptual-Motor Skill Acquisition. Cognition and Ageing Brain</ref> Though it would seem then that younger people are generally superior to older in skill acquisition (with some studies proving this to be true)<ref name="Daselaar">Daselaar, S.M. (2003). Similar network activated by young and old adults during the acquisition of a motor sequence. Neurobiology of Aging, 24. 1013-1019</ref>,predominantly it has been established that no significant difference is found in the procedural memory of the young and old. This is because although younger brains acquire information quickly and efficiently, older individuals close the gap through practice<ref name="Kennedy"/>. People in both younger and older age groups not only perform similarly on non-declarative learning tests, but also in the use of neuroimaging: fMRIs have shown that there is little difference in basal ganglia and cerebellum activity (the areas of the brain noted for procedural memory) for these age groups<ref name="Daselaar"/>.<br/>-This difference in procedural memory is not unlike the effects of amnesia- [[Alzheimer's]], a disease of progressive forgetting (among other symptoms)that is often associated with aging, also shows a remarkable retention in procedural learning ability. This preservation of procedural memory is interesting as well because of the decline in other forms of memory, namely declarative<ref>Yamadori, A. et al (1996). Procedural Memory in Alzheimer's Disease. Neurobiology of Aging, 17. 578</ref>.<br/>-<br/>-==Lesions, Injury and Procedural Memory==<br/>-<br/>-Overall the mechanisms responsible for procedural memory are poorly understood at present. However, it has been found that patients who have had portions of their medial temporal lobes surgically removed still have intact procedural memory.<ref name = Budson>Budson, A.E., Prince, B.H. (2005). Memory Dysfunction. New England Journal of Medicine, 352. 692-699</ref> For individuals who have lesions in the basal ganglia or cerebellum procedural memory will be affected, indicating that this area is critically involved in procedural memory. The importance of the basal ganglia and the cerebellum in procedural learning is supported by functional imagery which shows that the motor area, basal ganglia and cerebellum become active as a new task is being learned<ref name = Budson/>. Patients with tumors, strokes and other causes of damage to the basal ganglia or cerebellum provided further support for this finding as damage to those areas can leave patients with impaired procedural memory.<ref name = Budson/><br/>-''Children with [[Traumatic Brain Injury]]:'' Adults who suffer from Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), show similar learning rates to those who do not have TBI<ref name = Hanten> Hanten, G., Dennis, M., Zhang, L., Barnes, M. (2004). Childhood Head Injury and Metacongitive Processes in Language and Memory. Developmental Neuropsychology, 25. 85-105</ref>. In considering a younger population, there has been some questions regarding the effect of pediatric traumatic brain injury on procedural memory. However, the study’s results have shown that consistent with literature on adult suffers of TBI, procedural memory will also be preserved in children with TBI. <ref name = Hanten/> This result is most likely due to the fact that TBI tends to affect the anterior and medial regions of the brain opposed to the inferior regions which are responsible for implicit memory, including procedural learning and skill acquisition. <ref name = Hanten/><br/>-<br/>-=The Impact of Sleep on Procedural memory=<br/>-<br/>-Sleep cycles play critical roles in offline consolidation of memories.<br/>-<br/>-==== Consolidation ====<br/>-<br/>-Memory [[consolidation]] is a relatively poorly defined term in the literature for a series of cognitive processes that stabilize and enhance the efficacy of memory representations that are initially unstable when first formed. [[Encoding]], which takes information from short-term working memory and creates a memory trace for that information which is then consolidated into long-term memory, is rapid and is believed to occur across milliseconds. Encoding and consolidation appear to be distinct processes involving different molecular mechanisms, brain structures and regions, time courses as well as networks <ref name=Stickgold>Stickgold, R., & Walker, M. P. (2007). Sleep-dependent memory consolidation and reconsolidation. Sleep Medicine, 8, 331-343. </ref>.<br/>-<br/>-The time required for memories to become consolidated is functionally related to the stability of those memories and their impermeability to interference. In addition, other similar memories can compete with a memory being consolidated and thus interfere. This interference through competition may actually serve as an advantage by allowing for the amendment of inaccurately formed memories prior to stabilization <ref name=Stickgold/>.<br/>-<br/>-==== Purpose of consolidation ====<br/>-<br/>-Behavioural facilitation: <br/>-# Automatization: converting previously declarative memory representations to non-declarative procedural representations that require less conscious effort and fewer demands on brain structures such as the frontal lobes.<br/>-# Extraction: taking information from a consolidated episodic memory and converting that information with the absence of episodic aspects (such as context and chronological information) into a semantic memory.<br/>-# Integration: creating associations between related information <ref name=Stickgold/>.<br/>-<br/>-Consolidation enhances memories, which influence behaviour and performance in the absence of additional practice. In consolidation it appears as though long after stabilization has occurred enhancement of the memory continues to take place. In certain tasks, such as visual discrimination and procedural learning, enhancement appears to occur during sleep cycles. Consolidation also integrates newly formed memories into already established networks; sleep cycles appear to be critically involved in processes of memory integration and memory erasure <ref name=Stickgold/>.<br/>-<br/>-=== Sleep-Dependent Processes === <br/>-<br/>-There are many stages of sleep and those stages are associated with the different stages of memory formation, encoding, consolidation and reconsolidation are associated <ref name=Fogel> Fogel, S. M., Carlyle, T. S., & Cote, K. A. (2007). Dissociable learning-dependent changes in REM and non-REM sleep in declarative and procedural memory systems. Behavioural Brain Research, 180, 48-61. </ref> <ref name=Stickgold/>. <br/>-<br/>-Phases of sleep: <br/>-# Rapid eye movement (REM).<br/>-# Non-rapid eye movement (NREM); this stage is divided into four sub-stages that are distinct in their role in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Sub-stages 3 and 4 (the deepest form of sleep) are known as slow wave sleep (SWS) and have low frequency cortical oscillations (ranging from .5-4 Hz) <ref name=Stickgold/>.<br/>-<br/>-Sleep cycles such as REM, stage 2, and slow wave sleep (SWS) have been identified as stages critically involved in sleep-dependent processes. Distinct cortical activation has been correlated with those stages of sleep <ref name=StickgoldR> Stickgold, R. (2005). Sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Nature, 437, 1272-1278. </ref>.<br/>-<br/>-Sleep cycles are complex and vary depending on brain region, physiology, chemistry and experience. Different aspects and systems of memory consolidation can be influenced by different cycles of sleep, some of which appear crucial while others not <ref name=Stickgold/>. So-called ‘sleep-dependent processes’ are labeled thus because they are believed to take place during sleep cycles. However, this does not mean that they occur during sleep cycles only; wake cycles are also relevant and critical to those sleep-dependent processes <ref name=StickgoldR/> . Wake cycles have been demonstrated to be involved in stabilization of procedural memories, distinguishing consolidation for explicit and implicit memory <ref name=Stickgold/>.<br/>-<br/>-Training itself can influence sleep cycle patterns and correlated brain activity with regions associated with the memories being enhanced (for example, there was observed improvement from overnight sleep associated with hippocampal activation during SWS after training for a spatial learning task). Critically, the features of the individual task to be learned are factors for sleep-dependent memory consolidation <ref name=Stickgold/>.<br/>-<br/>-=== Sleep and Procedural Memory Consolidation ===<br/>-<br/>-Procedural/ non-declarative memory appears to be associated more so with non-REM sleep and declarative memory appears to be more associated with REM sleep. However, REM sleep has been associated with enhancing the efficacy of memory consolidation for procedural memory, demonstrating that stages in sleep are not restricted to one type or aspect of memory consolidation <ref name=Fogel/>  <ref name=Stickgold/>.<br/>-<br/>-After a period of procedural memory training an increase in [[sleep spindles]] and rapid eye movements can be observed. There is also an increase in non-REM activity, which has typically been accepted as being deeper sleep <ref name=Stickgold/>.<br/>-Non-REM activation may be associated with synaptic plasticity in the brain and may be related to the consolidation of procedural memory after training. In particular, stage 2 has been associated with procedural memory consolidation in Pursuit Rotor tasks- a simple, implicit motor skill task that does not necessitate the individual to adopt new strategies (which would require conscious effort and therefore by definition become explicit in nature) to improve in task performance. Some forms of declarative memory appears to be more correlated with increased REM theta wave activity, however this may depend on the nature of the task being learned <ref name=Fogel/> .<br/>-<br/>-Individuals with lower skill levels for a particular task demonstrate more changes in REM sleep (which appear to be learning-dependent). In contrast individuals with greater skill levels for the same task appear to have more changes in stage 2 non-REM sleep. In other words when a skill is more challenging in its acquisition there are learning-dependent changes in REM sleep whereas when a skill is being refined then those learning-dependent changes are observed in stage 2 sleep <ref name=Fogel/> .<br/>-<br/>-At present there is too little evidence to identify all the different types of post-encoding processes <ref name=StickgoldR/>. <br/>-<br/>-Evidence from tasks such as visual texture discrimination, motor adaptation, and motor sequencing have supported that overnight sleep correlates to performance enhancement in those tasks, whereas the same time period where participants were awake did not <ref name=Fogel/>  <ref> Fischer, S., Hallschmid, M., Elsner, A.

Visual discrimination learning requires sleep after training. Nature Neuroscience, 3(12), 1237-1238. </ref>. However, this is not to imply that all memories have the potential to be enhanced during sleep cycles alone, irrespective of waking cycles. Sleep-dependent memory consolidation involves different stages of sleep depending on the nature of the memory and more than one stage of sleep may be involved in any particular memory’s consolidation <ref name=StickgoldR/>.<br/>-<br/>-A caution for all studies that assess sleep’s impact on procedural memory is that fatigue, practice and circadian rhythms may affect performance <ref name=Robertson/>. In addition, this research is correlationally based and therefore does not allow for inferences of causation. There are also issues with metaphor as the overarching theoretical paradigms used to describe cognitive phenomena risk researchers becoming caught up in definitions provided by the metaphor (and paradigm) and may result in the negligence of other critically involved factors.<br/>-<br/>-=Testing Procedural Memory=<br/>-<br/>-The testing of procedural memory is similar to that of any other type of memory. A variety of tests can be used.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-One type of procedural learning that can be measured is motor learning; through the use of such tests as pursuit rotor tracking and mirror tracing tasks.<ref name = Kern>Kern, R.S., Green, M.F., Wallace, F.W., Charles, J.

A participant is asked to trace the image on the base, using feedback from the mirror image, as direct view is obstructed. The ratio of time on target and the total time to draw the image is what is measured.<ref>Van Gorp, W.G., Altshuler, L., Theberge, D.C., Mintz, J. (1999).

This task is modeled off of the oriental puzzle, the [[Tower of Hanoi]]. <ref name=Vicari/> The Tower of London consists of a wooden base with 3 perpendicular sticks of varying length attached to it and three different coloured balls each with a hole in the center. <ref name = Vicari/> To begin an examiner will arrange the balls in a certain order and then disrupt the pattern. The examinee will then have to remember the original pattern and reproduce it. <ref name = Vicari/>. As trials continue the patterns become longer and more complicated. For example, the first trial may consist of just a three-pattern sequence of red ball, green ball, yellow ball. The next trial could be the first sequence (of red, green, yellow) and then another sequence of green, yellow, red. While each pattern only ever contains 3 different balls, a trial could contain many sets of patterns. Examinees gain performance points based on the amount of time it took them to get the sequence correct, with the assumption of the test being that if performance improves it is because the participant was learning the pattern and using procedural memory<ref name = Vicari/>. <br/>-<br/>-Such test may be appropriate if it is suspected that impairments to procedural memory are the cause of a patients inability to learn new skills or the loss of previously learned skills<ref name=Budson> Budson, A.C., Price, B.H.

It includes the religious holidays of [[Palm Sunday]], [[Maundy Thursday]] (Holy Thursday), [[Good Friday]], and [[Holy Saturday]].  It does not include [[Easter Sunday]]. In Eastern Orthodox tradition, Holy Week starts on [[Lazarus Saturday]], the day before Palm Sunday. (Easter Sunday, for context, is the first day of the new season of the Great Fifty Days, or [[Eastertide]], there being fifty days from Easter Sunday through Pentecost Sunday.) It is followed by [[Easter Week]].<br/>+<br/>+==History  ==<br/>+Holy Week in the [[Christian year]] is the week immediately before Easter. The earliest Catholic allusion to the custom of marking this week as a whole with special observances is to be found in the [[Apostolical Constitutions]] (v. 18, 19), dating from the latter half of the 3rd century and 4th century. In this text, abstinence from flesh is commanded for all the days, while for the Friday and Sunday an absolute fast is commanded. Dionysius Alexandrinus in his canonical epistle (AD 260), refers to the 91 fasting days implying that the observance of them had already become an established usage in his time.<ref>Apostolical Constitutions v. 18, 19</ref> <br/>+<br/>+There is some doubt about the genuineness of an ordinance attributed to [[Constantine I|Constantine]], in which abstinence from public business was enforced for the seven days immediately preceding [[Easter]] Sunday, and also for the seven which followed it; the ''[[Codex]] Theodosianus'', however, is explicit in ordering that all actions at law should cease, and the doors of all courts of law be closed during those 15 days (1. ii. tit. viii.). Of the particular days of the "great week" the earliest to emerge into special prominence was naturally Good Friday. Next came the ''Sabbatum Magnum'' ("Great Sabbath", i.e., [[Holy Saturday]] or Easter Eve) with its [[Paschal vigil|vigil]], which in the [[early church]] was associated with an expectation that the [[second advent]] would occur on an Easter Sunday.<br/>+<br/>+There are other [[Scriptures]] that refer to the traditions of the Early Church, most notably ''The Pilgrimage of Etheria'' (also known as ''The Pilgrimage of [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]]'') which details the complete observance of Holy Week in the early church.<br/>+<br/>+==Holy Week in Latin Rite Catholicism==<br/>+<br/>+===Palm Sunday (Passion Sunday)===<br/>+{{Main|Palm Sunday}}<br/>+Holy Week begins with what in the [[Roman Rite]] is now called Palm Sunday of the Passion of the Lord. Before 1955 it was known simply as Palm Sunday and the preceding Sunday as Passion Sunday. From 1955 to 1971 it was called Second Sunday in Passiontide or Palm Sunday.<br/>+<br/>+To commemorate the entrance of the messiah into [[Jerusalem]], to accomplish his [[paschal mystery]], it is customary to have before Mass a blessing of [[Arecaceae|palm leaves]] (or other branches, for example olive branches). The blessing ceremony, preferably held outside the church includes the reading of a Gospel account of how Jesus rode into Jerusalem humbly on a donkey, reminiscent of a Davidic victory procession, and how people placed palms on the ground in front of him. Immediately following this great time of celebration in the entering of Jesus into Jerusalemé, he begins his journey to the cross. This is followed by a procession or solemn entrance into the church, with the participants holding the blessed branches in their hands.<br/>+<br/>+The Mass itself includes a reading of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], the narrative of Jesus' capture, sufferings and death, as recounted in one of the [[Synoptic Gospels]].<br/>+<br/>+Before the reform of the rite by [[Pope Pius XI]], the blessing of the palms occurred inside the church within a service that followed the general outline of a Mass, with Collect, Epistle and Gospel, as far as the Sanctus. The palms were then blessed with five prayers, and a procession went out of the church and on its return included a ceremony for the reopening of the doors, which had meantime been shut. After this the normal Mass was celebrated.<ref name=prePXII>[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/missale-romanum.pdf 1920 typical edition of the Roman Missal]</ref><br/>+<br/>+===Monday to Wednesday===<br/>+The days between Palm Sunday and Holy Thursday are known as [[Holy Monday]], [[Holy Tuesday]], and [[Holy Wednesday]].  The Gospels of these days recount events not all of which occurred on the corresponding days between Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and his [[Last Supper]].  For instance, the Monday Gospel tells of the [[Anointing of Jesus|Anointing]] at [[Bethany (Biblical village)|Bethany]] ({{bibleverse||John|12:1-9}}), which occurred before the Palm Sunday event described in {{bibleverse||John|12:12-19}}.<br/>+<br/>+The [[Chrism]] Mass, whose texts the [[Roman Missal]] now gives under Holy Thursday, may be brought forward to one of these days, to facilitate participation by as many as possible of the clergy of the diocese together with the bishop. This Mass was not included in editions of the Roman Missal before the time of Pope Pius XII. In this Mass the bishop blesses separate oils for the sick (used in [[Anointing of the Sick]]), for [[catechumen]]s (used in [[Baptism]]) and [[chrism]] (used in Baptism, but especially in [[Confirmation]] and [[Ordination|Holy Orders]], as well as in rites such as the blessing of an altar and a church).<br/>+<br/>+===Tenebrae===<br/>+When the principal services of Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Easter Vigil were celebrated in the morning, the office of  [[Matins]] and [[Lauds]] of each day was celebrated on the evening of the preceding day in the service known as [[Tenebrae (liturgy)|Tenebrae]] (Latin, "Darkness").<br/>+<br/>+===Maundy (Holy) Thursday===<br/>+{{Main|Mass of the Lord's Supper}}<br/>+On this day the private celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] is forbidden.<ref>[http://www.saginaw.org/images/LITguide08_PARTII.pdf Holy Thursday: Number of Masses]</ref> Thus, apart from the [[Chrism]] Mass for the blessing of the Holy Oils that the diocesan bishop may celebrate on the morning of [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], but also on some other day close to Easter, the only Mass on this day is the evening [[Mass of the Lord's Supper]], which inaugurates the period of three days, known as the [[Easter Triduum]], that includes [[Good Friday]] (seen as beginning with the service of the preceding evening), [[Holy Saturday]] and [[Easter]] Sunday up to [[Vespers|evening prayer]] on that day.<ref name=General>[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/2/SubIndex/38/ContentIndex/101/Start/97 General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 19]</ref><br/>+<br/>+The Mass of the Lord's Supper commemorates the [[Last Supper]] of Jesus with his [[Twelve Apostles]], "the institution of the [[Eucharist]], the institution of the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]], and the [[The New Commandment|commandment]] of brotherly love that Jesus gave after washing the feet of his disciples."<ref>[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/2/SubIndex/38/ContentIndex/324/Start/319 Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper], 45</ref><br/>+<br/>+All the bells of the church, including altar bells, may be rung during the ''[[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]]'' of the Mass (the Gloria is not traditionally sung during the entire Lenten season). The bells and the organ then fall silent until the Gloria at the [[Easter Vigil]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In some countries, children are sometimes told: "The bells have flown to Rome."<br/>+<br/>+The Roman Missal recommends that, if considered pastorally appropriate, the priest should, immediately after the homily, celebrate the rite of [[Foot washing#Roman Catholic practice|washing the feet]] of an unspecified number of men, customarily twelve, recalling the number of the Apostles.<br/>+<br/>+A sufficient number of [[host (liturgy)|hosts]] are consecrated for use also in the Good Friday service, and at the conclusion the Blessed Sacrament is carried in procession to a place of reposition away from the main body of the church, which, if it involves an altar, is often called an "[[altar of repose]]".<br/>+<br/>+The altars of the church (except the one used for altar of repose) are later stripped quite bare and, to the extent possible, crosses are removed from the church or veiled.  (In the pre-Vatican II rite, crucifixes and statues are covered with violet covers during Passion time, but the crucifix covers can be white instead of violet on Holy Thursday.)<br/>+<br/>+===Good Friday===<br/>+{{Main|Good Friday}}<br/>+Roman Catholic Christians treat Good Friday as a [[fasting|fast day]], which is defined as only having one full meal with, if needed, two small snacks that together do not make a full meal.<br/>+<br/>+The Catholic Good Friday in the [[Roman Rite]] afternoon service involves a series of readings and meditations, as well as the (sung) reading of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] account from the [[Gospel of John]] which is often read dramatically, with the priest, one or more readers, and the congregation all taking part. In the traditional Latin liturgy, the Passion is read by the priest facing the altar, with three deacons chanting in the sanctuary facing the people.  Unlike Roman Catholic services on other days, the Good Friday service is not a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and in fact, celebration of Catholic Mass on Good Friday is forbidden.  [[Eucharist]] consecrated the night before ([[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]]) may be distributed. The [[cross]] is presented, with the people given an opportunity to [[veneration|venerate]] it. The services also include a long series of formal intercessions. The solemnity and somberness of the occasion has led to a phenomenon whereby in the course of history the liturgical provisions have a tendency to persist without substantial modification, even over the centuries<!--(Anton Baumstark)-->. Some churches hold a three-hour mediation from midday, the [[Three Hours' Agony]]. In some countries, such as Malta, Philippines, Italy and Spain, processions with statues representing the Passion of Christ are held.<br/>+[[Image:Quito Proc del Jesus del Gran Poder 2010 a.jpg|thumb|A Good Friday procession in Ecuador.]]<br/>+<br/>+* The Church mourns for Christ's death, reveres the Cross, and marvels at his life for his obedience until death.<br/>+* The only sacraments celebrated are [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]] and Anointing of the Sick.  While there is no celebration of the Eucharist, Holy Communion is distributed to the faithful only in the Service of the Passion of the Lord, but can be taken at any hour to the sick who are unable to attend this service.<br/>+* The altar remains completely bare, without texts, candlesticks, or altar cloths.<br/>+* It is customary to empty the holy water fonts in preparation of the blessing of the water at the Easter Vigil.<ref>[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/LawText/Index/6/LawIndex/46 Letter of the Congregation for Divine Worship, 14 March 2003]</ref><br/>+* The [[Stations of the Cross]] are often prayed either in the church or outside.<br/>+* The Celebration of the Passion of the Lord takes place in the afternoon, ideally at three o'clock, but for pastoral reasons a later hour may be chosen.<br/>+* Since 1970, the colour of the vestments is red.

In the darkness (often in a side chapel of the church building or, preferably, outside the church), a new fire is kindled and blessed by the priest. This new fire symbolizes the light of salvation and hope that God brought into the world through Christ's Resurrection, dispelling the darkness of sin and death. From this fire is lit the [[Paschal candle]], symbolizing the Light of Christ. This Paschal candle will be used throughout the season of Easter, remaining in the sanctuary of the Church or near the lectern, and throughout the coming year at baptisms and funerals, reminding all that that Christ is "light and life."<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Maria Lichtmess.jpg|thumb|right|Candles lit for the Easter Vigil at [[Heiligenkreuz Abbey]] in Austria.]]<br/>+All baptized Catholics present (i.e. those who have received the "Light of Christ") receive candles which are lit from the Paschal candle. As this symbolic "Light of Christ" spreads throughout those gathered, the darkness is decreased. A deacon, or the priest if there is no deacon, carries the Paschal Candle at the head of the entrance procession and, at three points, stops and chants the proclamation "Light of Christ" or "Christ our Light", to which the people respond "Thanks be to God." Once the procession concludes, the deacon or a cantor chants the [[Exultet]] (also called the "Easter Proclamation"), and, the church remaining lit only by the people's candles and the Paschal candle, the people take their seats for the Liturgy of the Word.<br/>+<br/>+The Liturgy of the Word consists of between two and seven readings from the [[Old Testament]]. The account of the Exodus is given particular attention in the readings since it is considered to be the Old Testament antetype of Christian salvation. Each reading is followed by a psalm and a prayer relating what has been read in the Old Testament to the Mystery of Christ. After these readings conclude, a fanfare may sound on the organ and additional musical instruments and the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]] is sung.  During this outburst of musical jubilation the congregation's candles are extinguished, the church lights are turned on, and bells rung while the church's decorative funnings — altar frontals, the reredos, lectern hangings, processional banners, statues and paintings — which had been stripped or covered during Holy Week, are ceremonially replaced and unveiled and flowers are placed on altars and elsewhere. (In the pre-Vatican II rite, the statues, which have been covered during Passion Time, are unveiled at this time. In some places, the church removes the covering of statues and puts Easter flowers and decorations on the day of Holy Saturday before the Easter Vigil celebration. Also, in the current ritual the lights are turned on after the last proclamation of 'Christ our Light'.) Members of the congregation may have been encouraged to bring flowers which are also brought forward and placed about the sanctuary and side altars. A reading from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] is proclaimed. The [[Alleluia]] is sung for the first time since the beginning of Lent (or, in the pre-Vatican II rite, since Septuagesima). The [[Gospel]] of the Resurrection then follows, along with a homily.<br/>+<br/>+After the conclusion of the Liturgy of the Word, the water of the [[baptismal font]] is consecrated and any [[catechumen]]s or candidates for full communion are initiated into the church, by [[baptism]] and/or [[Confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]], respectively.

The Misteri are amongst the oldest continuously running religious events in Europe, having been played every Good Friday since before the Easter of 1612, and running for at least 16 continuous hours, but occasionally well beyond the 24 hours; they are the longest religious festival in Sicily and in Italy. Similar but smaller or shorter passion processions are held in many other Sicilian cities, like [[Erice]] and [[Caltanissetta]], but also in various Southern Italian cities, like [[Salerno]] and [[Taranto]].<br/>+<br/>+====Malta====<br/>+{{Main|Holy Week in Malta}}<br/>+The Holy Week commemorations reach their paramount on Good Friday as the Catholic Church celebrates the passion of Jesus. Solemn celebrations take place in all churches together with processions in different villages around [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]]. During the celebration, the narrative of the passion is read in some localities. The Cross follows a significant Way of Jesus. Good Friday processions take place in [[Birgu]], [[Bormla]], [[Għaxaq]], [[Luqa]], [[Mosta]], [[Naxxar]], [[Paola, Malta|Paola]], [[Qormi]], [[Rabat]], [[Senglea]], [[Valletta]], [[Żebbuġ, Malta|Żebbuġ]] and [[Żejtun]].

The Church keeps the day solemn by not tolling the church bells, and no mass will be celebrated. In some communities (most famously in [[City of San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], [[Pampanga]]), the processions include devotees who self-flagellate and sometimes even have themselves nailed to crosses as expressions of penance. After three o'clock in the afternoon of Good Friday (the time at which Jesus is traditionally believed to have died), noise is discouraged, some [[radio|radio stations]] and [[television|television stations]] sign off (while others remain signed-on, broadcasting Religious Programming), businesses automatically close, and the faithful are urged to keep a solemn and prayerful disposition through to [[Easter]] Sunday.<br/>+<br/>+At [[Mass]] on [[Palm Sunday]], Catholics carry "palaspas" or palm leaves to be blessed by the priest.  Many Filipinos bring home the palm leaves after the Mass and place these above their front doors or their windows, believing that doing so can ward off evil spirits.  Holy Monday marks the beginning of the Pabasa (literally, reading) or [[Pasyon]], the marathon chanting of the story of Jesus' life, passion, and death, which continues day and night, for as long as two straight days.  A popular Holy Thursday tradition is the ''Bisita Iglesia'' (Church Visit), which involves visiting several Churches at which the faithful would pray the [[Stations of the Cross]]. The last Mass before [[Easter]] is also celebrated on Holy Thursday, usually including a reenactment of the [[Washing of the Feet]] of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]; this Mass is followed by the procession of the [[Blessed Sacrament]] before it is taken to the [[Altar of Repose]].  [[Good Friday]] in the Philippines is commemorated with street processions, the [[Way of the Cross]], the commemoration of Jesus' [[Seven last words]] (Siete Palabras) and a Passion play called the [[Passion play|Sinakulo]].<br/>+<br/>+Easter morning is marked with joyous celebration, the first being the dawn [[Salubong]], wherein large statues of Jesus and Mary are brought in procession together to meet, imagining the first reunion of Jesus and his mother Mary after Jesus' [[Resurrection]].

A tradition that dates from [[Middle Ages|medieval times]] which has spread to other cities in [[Andalusia]], the ''"Semana Santa en Sevilla"'' is notable for featuring the procession of '''"pasos"''', lifelike wood or plaster sculptures of individual scenes of the events that happened between Jesus' arrest and his burial, or images of the Virgin Mary showing grief for the torture and killing of her son.  In Málaga the lifelike wooden or plaster sculptures are called "tronos" and they are carried through the streets by penitents dressed in long purple robes, often with pointed hats, followed by women in black carrying candles for up to 11 hours.  These pasos and tronos are physically carried on the necks of ''costaleros'' (literally "sack men", because of the ''costal'', a sack-like cloth that they wear over their neck, to soften the burden) or "braceros" (this name is popular in Leon), and can weigh up to five metric tonnes. The pasos are set up and maintained by ''hermandades'' and ''cofradías'', religious brotherhoods that are common to a specific area of the city, whose precede the paso dressed in Roman military costumes or penitential robes. Those members who wish to do so wear these penitential robes with conical hats, or ''[[capirotes]]'', used to conceal the face of the wearer. These "Nazarenos" or "Papones" (this word it´s typical from Leon) carry processional candles, may walk the city streets barefoot, and may carry shackles and chains in their feet as penance. A brass band, marching band, a drum and bugle band, or in Málaga's case a military band (such as that of the [[Spanish Legion]] or other military units) may accompany the group, playing funeral marches, hymns or "marchas" written for the occasion.<br/>+<br/>+====Venezuela====<br/>+* [[Miranda (state)|Miranda]]<br/>+** [[Tacarigua de Mamporal]]<br/>+** [[Guatire]]<br/>+* [[Caracas]]<br/>+<br/>+====Vietnam====<br/>+* [[:vi:Tuần Thánh|Tuần Thánh]]<br/>+<br/>+==Holy Week in Eastern Christianity==<br/>+<br/>+===Eastern Orthodoxy===<br/>+<br/>+In the [[Orthodox Church]], [[Great Lent]] ends on the Friday before Palm Sunday, though the faithful will continue fasting until [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter). The day before Palm Sunday is called [[Lazarus Saturday]] and commemorates the [[resurrection]] of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]].  On Lazarus Saturday wine and oil are allowed (and, in the Russian tradition, [[caviar]]). [[Palm Sunday]] is considered one of the [[Great Feasts]] of the Lord, and is celebrated with fish, wine and oil. Because it is a Great Feast of the Lord, the normal Resurrectional elements of the Sunday [[All Night Vigil]] are omitted; however, these resurrectional elements are inserted into the Lazarus Saturday service with its theme of anticipating the [[Resurrection of Jesus]].<br/>+<br/>+Holy Week is referred to as "Great and Holy Week".  [[Matins#Eastern Christianity|Orthros]] (Matins) services for each day are held on the preceding evening. Thus, the Matins service of Great Monday is sung on Palm Sunday evening, and so on. This permits more of the faithful to attend, and shows that during Holy Week the times are out of joint—Matins ends up being served in the evening, and in some places [[Vespers]] is served in the morning.<br/>+<br/>+[[Fasting]] during Great and Holy Week is very strict. Dairy products and meat products are strictly forbidden.  On most days, no alcoholic beverages are permitted and no oil is used in the cooking.  Friday and Saturday are observed as strict fast days, meaning that nothing should be eaten on those days. However, fasting is always adjusted to the needs of the individual, and those who are very young, ill or elderly are not expected to fast as strictly. Those who are able to, may receive the blessing of their [[spiritual father]] to observe an even stricter fast, whereby they eat only two meals that week: one on Wednesday night and one after [[Divine Liturgy]] on Thursday.<br/>+<br/>+====Great and Holy Monday through Wednesday====<br/>+{{Main|Holy Monday|Holy Tuesday|Holy Wednesday}}<br/>+[[Image:5208-20080122-1255UTC--jerusalem-calvary.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of Christ the Bridegroom, sitting above the star at [[Golgotha]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]].]]<br/>+<br/>+In Eastern Orthodoxy the day begins at sunset, so the first service of each day is [[Vespers]], at which [[sticheron|stichera]] are chanted commemorating the theme of the day.<br/>+<br/>+The Orthros services of Palm Sunday through Tuesday evenings are often referred to as the "Bridegroom Prayer", because of their theme of Christ as the Bridegroom of the Church, a theme expressed in the [[troparion]] that is solemnly chanted during them. On these days, an [[icon]] of the "Bridegroom" is placed on an [[analogion]] in the center of the [[temple]], portraying Jesus wearing the purple [[robe]] of mockery and crowned with a [[crown of thorns]] (see [[Instruments of the Passion]]). The same theme is repeated in the [[exapostilarion]], a hymn which occurs near the end of the service. These services follow much the same pattern as services on weekdays of [[Great Lent]]. The services are so laid out that the entire [[Psalter]] (with the exception of [[Kathisma]] XVII) is chanted on the first three days of Holy Week. The [[canon (hymnography)|canon]] that is chanted on these days is a "Triode", i.e., composed of three [[ode]]s instead of the usual nine odes (the canon of Holy and Great Tuesday is a "Diode", having only two odes).<br/>+<br/>+Towards the end of the Tuesday evening Bridegroom service (Orthros for Great and Holy Wednesday), the ''[[Kassia|Hymn of Kassiani]]'' is sung. The [[hymn]], (written in the 9th century by [[Kassia]]) tells of the woman who washed Christ's feet in the house of [[Simon the Pharisee]]. ({{bibleverse||Luke|7:36-50|KJV}}) Much of the hymn is written from the perspective of the sinful woman:<br/>+<br/>+:''O Lord, the woman who had fallen into many sins, sensing Your Divinity, takes upon herself the duty of a myrrh-bearer. With lamentations she brings you myrrh in anticipation of your entombment. "Woe to me!" she cries, "for me night has become a frenzy of licentiousness, a dark and moonless love of sin. Receive the fountain of my tears, O You who gathers into clouds the waters of the sea. Incline unto me,  unto the sighings of my heart, O You who bowed the heavens by your ineffable condescension. I will wash your immaculate feet with kisses and dry them again with the tresses of my hair; those very feet at whose sound Eve hid herself from in fear when she heard You walking in Paradise in the twilight of the day. As for the multitude of my sins and the depths of Your judgments, who can search them out, O Savior of souls, my Savior? Do not disdain me Your handmaiden, O You who are boundless in mercy."''<br/>+<br/>+The Byzantine musical composition expresses the poetry so strongly that it leaves many people in a state of prayerful tears. The Hymn can last upwards of 25 minutes and is liturgically and musically a highpoint of the entire year.<br/>+<br/>+On Great and Holy Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday the [[Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] is celebrated, at which the faithful may receive [[Holy Communion]] from the [[Reserved Sacrament|reserved]] [[Holy Mysteries]].

Also, beginning at this service there will be no more reading of the psalter for the rest of Holy Week, with the exception of [[kathisma]] XVII at Orthros of Great and Holy Saturday.<br/>+<br/>+Divine Liturgy of the [[Last Supper]] is held on the morning of Great and Holy Thursday, combining Vespers with the [[Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great]]. There is a custom among some churches to place a simple white linnen cloth over the [[Holy Table]] (altar) for this Liturgy, reminiscent of the Last Supper. In cathedrals and [[monastery|monasteries]] it is customary for the [[bishop]] or [[hegumen]] (abbot) to celebrate the [[Washing of Feet]].

At one point, when we reach the first Gospel which speaks of the Crucifixion, there is a custom for the priest to bring out a large [[crucifix|cross]] with an [[icon]] the crucified Christ attached to it, and places it in the center of the [[nave]] for all the faithful to venerate.

Afterwards, all of the lighting in the church is extinguished and all remain in silence and darkness until the stroke of midnight. Then, the priest lights a single candle from the [[eternal flame]] on the altar (which is never extinguished). The light is spread from person to person until everyone holds a lighted candle. Then a procession takes place circling around the outside of the church, recreating the journey of the [[Myrrh Bearers]] as they journeyed to the [[Tomb of Jesus]] on the first Easter morning. The procession stops in front of the closed doors of the church. The opening of these doors symbolized the "rolling away of the stone" from the tomb by the angel, and all enter the church joyfully singing the [[Troparion]] of [[Easter|Pascha]]. Paschal Orthros begins with an [[Ektenia]] (litany) and the chanting of the Paschal [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]]. One of the highpoints is the sharing of the [[paschal kiss]] and the reading of the ''[[Paschal Homily|Hieratikon]]'' ([[Catechism|Catechetical]] [[Homily]] of [[John Chrysostom]]) by the priest. The Divine Liturgy follows, and every Orthodox Christian is encouraged to [[Confession (religion)|confess]] and receive [[Holy Communion]] on this holiest day of the year. A [[breakfast]] usually follows, sometimes lasting till dawn.

It consists of seven prayers, at the end of which every member of the congregation is anointed with Holy Oil.<br/>+<br/>+The following day - the last Saturday before Holy Week - is called "Lazarus' Saturday". On this day the Coptic Church commemorates Lazarus, the Brother of the LORD. Although this day doesn't have much significance in relation to the events of Holy week, it is placed there according to calendar date.<br/>+<br/>+Since the Liturgical day starts from the evening before an actual day, the prayers of Palm Sunday begin on the actual day of Lazarus' Saturday.<br/>+<br/>+Throughout Holy Week, there is a paschal service that is conducted every evening, starting Sunday night (eve of Monday), and every morning, up until Easter. These paschal services take place in the middle of the church, and not on the altar due to the fact that Jesus suffered and was crucified on Golgotha, which is outside of Jerusalem. The altar is bared of all its coverings and relics.<br/>+Each day service is divided into 5 hours; The First Hour, The Third Hour, The Sixth Hour, The Ninth Hour, and The Eleventh Hour.<br/>+Likewise, each night service is also divided into the same five hours. However, Good Friday has an extra hour added to it, that of The Twelfth Hour.<br/>+During each hour, one prophecy is read at the beginning, a hymn is chanted twelve times, a psalm is sung in a sad tune, one passage from a gospel is read, and an exposition concludes the hour.<br/>+**During the eve of Friday and Friday, four gospel passages are read, and more prophecies are read as well.<br/>+As of Tuesday night, the people do not greet each other. nor the priests, nor do they even kiss the icons of saints in the church, due to the fact that Judas betrayed Jesus with a kiss.<br/>+<br/>+On Maundy Thursday also called Covenant Thursday, which is the Thursday of holy week, a liturgy is prayed and communion is given to symbolize the last supper of Jesus. Also, after the liturgy the priests wash the congregation's feet to resemble Jesus washing his disciple's feet.<br/>+<br/>+Late Friday night until early Saturday morning is called Apocalypse Night. During this night, another liturgy is prayed and the entire book of the apocalypse is read, to symbolize the second coming. <br/>+<br/>+This is all concluded with the Easter liturgy that occurs on Saturday night, followed by a gathering in the church where the goers can eat together and celebrate the joy of the resurrection, as well as to bring an end to their long fast.(Abstinence from meat, fish, and dairy products)<br/>+<br/>+===Eastern Catholic Churches===<br/>+Holy Week for the Eastern Catholic Churches is the same as the Eastern Orthodox Churches.<br/>+<br/>+==Holy Week in Protestant churches==<br/>+[[Anglicans]]/[[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]], along with other Protestants in the Catholic liturgical tradition, such as [[Lutherans]], observe Holy Week much as the Roman Catholic Church does.

However, these Protestants conduct more informal celebrations of Holy Week, usually including sermons about the last week of Christ's life, and possibly some special services on Palm Sunday, Good Friday and or Easter Sunday.<br/>+<br/>+The consensus of modern scholarship is that the New Testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a Friday, but a Thursday or Wednesday crucifixion have also been proposed, especially in fundamentalist circles.<ref name=Nis167 /><ref name=Kellum142 >''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J.

Bozizé has strengthened military presence along the border and deployed an amphibious force patrolling the Ubangi river. There were refugees from DRC in C.A.R. from July 1999 (when Kabila advanced in the region bordering C.A.R.). The refugees were repatriated following an agreement between UNHCR and the governments of the two countries in 2004.

[[Akon]] has recently covered ""The Take Over, the Breaks Over"" song on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Live Lounge]].<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/jowhiley/galleries/1842/1/#gallery1842</ref><br/>+<br/>+The song features two guitar solos performed by [[Ryan Ross]] (from [[Panic! at the Disco]]) and [[Chad Gilbert]] (from [[New Found Glory]]).<br/>+<br/>+==Track listing==<br/>+'''CD single'''<br/>+#""The Take Over, the Breaks Over""<br/>+#"[[Thriller (Fall Out Boy song)|Thriller]]" ([[Sessions@AOL]] version)<br/>+<br/>+'''7" vinyl'''<br/>+#""The Take Over, the Breaks Over""<br/>+#"[[Sugar, We're Goin Down|Sugar, We're Goin' Down]]" (Sessions@AOL version)<br/>+<br/>+==Music video==<br/>+The music video is in [[Black-and-white|black and white]] and features the band performing in a dream of [[Pete Wentz]]'s dog, Hemingway. It begins with Hemingway (Pete's dog) sleeping on Wentz. It leads into Hemingway's dream where Fall Out Boy is performing next to a [[Chevrolet Impala|1968 Chevrolet Impala]] while Hemingway is seeing fire hydrants, mailmen, dancing catwomen, and lead vocalist/guitarist [[Patrick Stump]] with a large cat head and dressed as a steak. <br/>+It then leads into a bunch of ex-Fall Out Boy fans all wearing black and white shirts saying how much they dislike Fall Out Boy walking over to Fall Out Boy throwing water balloons at them. They yell at them saying how they don't like them anymore ("forgetting them"). Hemingway (in a cape) howls and says, "Give the boys a break... everybody changes". The fans nod their head and the dog continues, "I mean, look at me. I used to be tiny". The fans nod their heads again and go back to watching Fall Out Boy play as confetti falls down. The breakdancing mailmen and catwomen are dancing along also. Wentz then tells Hemingway, "I didn't know you could talk". Hemingway replies, "Shut up Pete... this is my dream." After finishing the song, Wentz falls suddenly in the dream and Hemingway abruptly wakes up, jumping off Wentz. <br/>+<br/>+The video was filmed in one day when Fall Out Boy were in [[New York City]]. ''[[Total Request Live]]'' currently has the song listed in the voting page under the misspelled title "The takeover, the break's over".
