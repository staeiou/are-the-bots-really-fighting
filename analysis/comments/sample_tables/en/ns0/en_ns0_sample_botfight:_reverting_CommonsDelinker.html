On 9 July 1921, a truce was declared. On 11 October negotiations were opened under British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] and Arthur Griffith, who headed the Irish Republic's delegation.  The Irish Treaty delegation set up Headquarters in [[Hans Place]], Knightsbridge and on 5 December 1921 at 11:15 am it was decided by the delegation during private discussions at 22 Hans Place to recommend the Treaty to the Dáil Éireann; negotiations continued until 2:30 am on 6 December 1921 after which the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] was signed by the parties.<br/> <br/>-<br/>+[[File:Michael Collins "Free State Demonstration" March 13, 1922.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] addressing a crowd in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] at a "Free State Demonstration" on 13 March 1922.]]<br/> That these negotiations would produce a form of Irish government short of the independence wished for by republicans was not in doubt. The United Kingdom could not offer a republican form of government without losing prestige and risking demands for something similar throughout the Empire. Furthermore, as one of the negotiators, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], later admitted (and he was in a position to know, given his role in the independence war), the IRA at the time of the truce was weeks, if not days, from collapse, with a chronic shortage of ammunition. "Frankly, we thought they were mad", Collins said of the sudden British offer of a truce, although it was likely they would have continued in one form or another, given the level of public support. The [[President of the Irish Republic|President of the Republic]], Éamon de Valera, realising that a republic was not on offer, decided not to be a part of the treaty delegation and so be tainted by more militant republicans as a "sellout". Yet his own proposals published in January 1922 fell far short of an autonomous all-Ireland republic.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}<br/> <br/> As expected, the Anglo-Irish Treaty explicitly ruled out a republic. What it offered was [[dominion]] status, as a state of the British Commonwealth, equal to Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Though less than expected by the Sinn Féin leadership, it was substantially more than the initial form of home rule within the United Kingdom sought by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] from 1880, and a serious advancement on the Home Rule Act of 1914 that the Irish nationalist leader [[John Redmond]] had achieved through parliamentary proceedings. However, it all but confirmed the [[partition of Ireland]] between [[Northern Ireland]] and the Irish Free State. It was ratified by the [[Second Dáil]], splitting Sinn Féin in the process.</td>

That Convention was not held because no single member of the Volunteer Executive of the time would recommend the holding of that Convention in the circumstances that then existed in Dublin. Delegates for this Convention were actually selected but the Convention was not held. Ballot papers were circulated to the delegates and a vote was taken as far as the question of the Oath was concerned. As far as this question was concerned, the amendment to the constitution was accepted.</ref>  The anti-Treaty IRA formed their own "Army Executive", which they declared to be the real government of the country, despite the result of the [[Irish elections, 1921|1921 general election]].

The best known tests of torpedoes are those conducted against a derelict ship, typically on ships from a Navy's own [[reserve fleet|mothball fleet]] that has become too old or obsolete to warrant maintaining. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the torpedo will work under combat conditions, and such tests can be used to determine whether or not [[noisemaker]]s or other [[decoy]]s will have any effect against the unit when launched.<br/> <br/> ===Use against training soldiers===</td>

Finally, the area above the reservoir section of the well is packed off inside the casing, and connected to the surface via a smaller diameter pipe called tubing. This arrangement provides a redundant barrier to leaks of hydrocarbons as well as allowing damaged sections to be replaced. Also, the smaller cross-sectional area of the tubing produces reservoir fluids at an increased velocity in order to minimize liquid fallback that would create additional back pressure, and shields the casing from corrosive well fluids.<br/> <br/>-<br/>+[[File:Labeled oil derrick.JPG|thumb|Labeled oil derrick]]<br/> <br/> In many wells, the natural pressure of the subsurface reservoir is high enough for the oil or gas to flow to the surface. However, this is not always the case, especially in depleted fields where the pressures have been lowered by other producing wells, or in low permeability oil reservoirs. Installing a smaller diameter tubing may be enough to help the production, but artificial lift methods may also be needed. Common solutions include downhole pumps, gas lift, or surface [[pumpjack|pump jacks]]. Many new systems in the last ten years have been introduced for well completion. Multiple [[Production packer|packer]] systems with frac ports or port collars in an all in one system have cut completion costs and improved production, especially in the case of horizontal wells.

Called B.H.P (highly resistant concrete), it offers a resistance to compression value of 1200 bars per sqcm (claimed to be a world record) and has a very quick setting time.<ref name=Moly/> This enabled the building of a taller structure with due underpinning of the foundation, while adhering to the construction schedule.

Before the sinking ''Torrens'' had been thoroughly cleaned of all fuels, oils and potentially environmentally harmful substances. Her gun turret was donated to the South Western City of [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]. ''Torrens'' was then towed from Fleet Base West (HMAS ''Stirling'') {{Convert|90|km|mi}} out to sea, west of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. The submarine fired the torpedo at the stationary target from a submerged position over the horizon.<br/> <br/> The sinking of ''Torrens'' was a display of firepower that provided some much needed positive publicity for the ''Collins'' class submarines, plagued by numerous technical problems and criticised over troubles with the combat system and noise reduction. Ric Shalders, commander of the Submarine Squadron said "the requirement of new submarine trials, the new need to test war-stock and the availability of the Torrens all came together to produce a very satisfactory result".<ref>{{cite web</td>

Drilling rigs can be mobile equipment mounted on trucks, tracks or trailers, or more permanent land or marine-based structures (such as [[oil platform]]s, commonly called 'offshore oil rigs' even if they don't contain a drilling rig).

This album was the band's record label, Love Records, the first gold record.<br/> <br/> ==Roadrunner (1974)==<br/>-<br/>+[[File:Roadrunnerhurriganes.jpg|thumb]]<br/> Hurriganes' commercial high point was released in 1974: [[Roadrunner (Hurriganes album)|Roadrunner]], an album that included the band's more traditional song "Get On", which won the International European Pop Jury competition. Also the songs "Roadrunner," "It Ain't What You Do," "I Will Stay" and "The Phone Rang" were classics. ''Roadrunner'' was recorded in Stockholm at Marcus Music Studios, and the album was also pressed in Stockholm. ''Roadrunner'' can be considered as one of the major Finnish rock albums, and it was Finland's best-selling album by a Finnish band in from 1974 until 1985, when the [[Dingo (band)|Dingos]]' ''Kerjäläisten valtakunta'' exceeded the volume of sales. Also the album cover art (by Risto Vuorimies) has become a classic: it was the only Finnish album cover in 1977's Hipgnosisin and Roger Dean's work Album Cover Album (Dragons, World Book). The ''Roadrunner'' cover was designed by Kari Korhonen, who also made a [[Donald Duck]] ("Rokkikukot") comic book version of the album cover. ''Roadrunner'' is still considered one of Finnish rock music's most important albums, and it is Finland's seventh-best-selling album of all time. The cover's stylish motif was chosen by Hurriganes' bassist Cisse Häkkinen, who owned a light blue 1954 Cadillac Series 62 sedan. The cover shows the Hurriganes' Remu Aaltonen, Cisse Häkkinen and Albert Järvinen posing elegantly in suits sitting on the back seat of the Cadillac. The car ended up in the ownership of Kari Niiranen, or "DJ Nite," a highly popular disc jockey who also toured with Hurriganes. ''Roadrunner'' is regarded as one of the best Finnish rock records ever released, and in 2007, it was re-released as a SACD mixed to a 5.1 format.<br/> <br/> ==Crazy Days: Kallio returns (1975)==</td>
