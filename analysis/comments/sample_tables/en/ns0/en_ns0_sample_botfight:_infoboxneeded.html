These eggs travel down variously contorted chutes to land safely in the basket perched on Big Bird's head. Most eggs count for a single point, but a golden egg will periodically appear that is worth five points. When an egg is dropped, a number of points are lost. At higher levels, the eggs move faster, the chutes become more convoluted, there are more egg-laying hens, and the chutes may even flash invisible.  The song that plays during the egg-catching ([[Turkey in the Straw]]), also increases in tempo.</td>

It allowed players to choose from ten real teams from various cities, and each team featured all the actual players that were currently playing for them. The game used an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] view, presenting the game at an angle to make it appear [[Three-dimensional space|3-D]], and the game allowed a very large number of moving objects (all the players) to be onscreen at the same time; in earlier games, the system couldn't handle it. In a typical NES game, few moving objects could be onscreen before they all started flashing, because the system couldn't render them all at once, but ''NES PAF'' managed to avoid this somehow and allow the system to render two entire football teams onscreen simultaneously. Another feature that was ahead of its time was the use of real voices. ''NES PAF'' was one of an extremely small number of NES games to feature voices. Most games never bothered to implement this feature because of the primitive sound capabilities, but in ''NES PAF'', players hear the [[referee]] say in a real voice "Touchdown!" or "First down!".

The [[treaty]] stated that the [[border|boundary]] between the [[France|French]] claims on the north and the [[Spain|Spanish]] claims on the south was Rio Roxo de Natchitoches ([[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]]) until it reached the [[100th meridian]] as noted on John Melish's map published in [[1818]]. The problem was that the 100th meridian on the Melish map was some 90 [[mile]]s east of the true 100th meridian and the Red River forked about 50 miles east of the 100th meridian. Texas claimed the land south of the North Fork and the United States claimed the land north of the South Fork (later called the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River).<br/> <br/> ==United States vs. State of Texas==<br/>-The dispute resulted in a [[lawsuit]], which, eventually wound up before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]&mdash;no [[federal district court|lower court]] having [[jurisdiction]].

Following that ruling, on [[May 4]] [[1896]], the land was officially assigned by [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] to [[Oklahoma Territory]]. The Greer County Homestead Law, passed just afterwards, gave the Texas settlers the 160 acres (647,000 m�) they were living on and the option to purchase an additional 160 acres (647,000 m�) for [[United States dollar|$1.00]] per acre ($247/km�).<br/>+The dispute resulted in a [[lawsuit]], which, eventually wound up before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]&mdash;no [[federal district court|lower court]] having [[jurisdiction]].
